## **Limitations**

The following limitations apply to this licence:

1. **Overrides Other Licences**:

   * This licence takes precedence over any existing licences applied to the material.
   * Any conflicting terms in other licences, including proprietary or closed-source licences, are nullified when this licence is applied.
   * Once licensed under the OSTL, the material cannot be re-licensed under a more restrictive licence.

2. **Open Source Requirement**: Any project using this licence must remain open source.

3. **Abandonment Clause**:

   * A project is considered **abandoned** if there are no substantial updates or maintenance (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, or security patches) for a consecutive period of **3 years**.
   * Substantial updates are defined as meaningful changes that improve functionality, usability, security, or compatibility. Trivial updates (e.g., cosmetic changes, minor text edits, or version number increments without improvements) do not reset the abandonment timer.
   * If a project is abandoned:

     * The licensed material and its derivatives automatically become public domain.
     * Responsibility for determining abandonment rests on community consensus, based on publicly verifiable project activity logs.
   * Active public communication from the original author(s) about the project’s status (e.g., dormancy or hiatus) can extend the abandonment period by up to **2 additional years**.
   * **Anti-Exploitation Clause**: Any deliberate or apparent attempt to exploit loopholes in this clause (e.g., releasing meaningless updates or obscuring activity logs) will result in **immediate transition of the licensed material and its derivatives into the public domain**, bypassing the standard abandonment period.
   * **Deceptive Practices Clause**: If the author(s) knowingly provide false information, misrepresent activity, or engage in deception to delay abandonment status, the licensed material and derivatives shall **immediately transition to the public domain**.

4. **Accidental Inclusion Clause**:

   * If this licence is included in any material, whether intentionally or accidentally, the material is immediately and irrevocably subject to the terms of this licence.
   * This clause applies regardless of the intent behind the inclusion and overrides any previous licences or claims of ownership.

5. **Mild Liability**:

   * The licensor and contributors are **not** liable for any damages arising from the use, modification, or distribution of the material, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive.
   * **Mild Liability** means that in the event of damage, the liability is **limited to a reasonable, minimal scope**. The maximum liability is restricted to **the amount paid for the material** (if any) or the **value of the material** (if provided for free).
   * In no case shall the licensor be held responsible for any **loss of profit**, **loss of data**, or other **intangible damages**, even if the licensor has been informed of the potential for such damages.

6. **Mild Warranty**:

   * The material is provided **"as is"**, without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
   * **Mild Warranty** means that while the material is provided as is, there is **no guarantee of accuracy, performance, or suitability** for any specific use case.
   * The entire risk arising out of the use or performance of the material remains with the user.

   * All parties agree that disputes or claims arising from or related to this licence or the licensed material shall not be resolved through arbitration.
   * Arbitration clauses or agreements cannot be imposed on users, contributors, or any parties involved with the licensed material.

2. **Jurisdiction**:

   * Any disputes or legal actions related to this licence must be handled exclusively in either **Canada** or the **United Kingdom**, as chosen by the aggrieved party.
   * The laws of the chosen jurisdiction shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this licence, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

---

## **Licence Override Clause**

* **Supersession**: When this licence is applied to any material, it immediately overrides and nullifies the terms of any previously applied licences, including but not limited to closed-source, proprietary, or other restrictive licences.
* **Irrevocability**: Once this licence is applied, the licensed material and all derivative works must remain under the OSTL. Attempts to revoke, re-licence, or modify the terms to be more restrictive are void.

---

**Disclaimer**: This licence is designed to ensure that projects remain open, community-driven, and transparent. By using this licence, you agree to abide by its terms. If you have questions or need clarification, please contact the original author(s).
